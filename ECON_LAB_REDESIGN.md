## 🏛 Core Principles

The redesign communicates **five foundational values**:

### 1. Inquiry over ideology
"Follow the evidence, not predetermined narratives. Question conventional wisdom. Explore controversial or neglected economic questions responsibly."

### 2. Clarity over complexity
"Make advanced methods accessible. Strip away jargon. Present economic analysis in ways that respect both rigor and comprehension."

### 3. Assumptions over black boxes
"All calculations are transparent. All methods are visible. Every analysis can be replicated and validated by others."

### 4. Evidence over rhetoric
"Data first, interpretation second. We provide tools and transparency. The conclusions are yours to draw."

### 5. Structure over noise
"Focus on long-run patterns and structural dynamics. Separate signal from noise. Find what matters."

### 6. Public responsibility (Bonus)
"Research has consequences. Communicate findings with nuance, acknowledge limitations, and respect the weight of public claims."
