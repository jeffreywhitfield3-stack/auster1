# The Research Stage: Auster's Public Research Institution

## Vision Statement

Auster is not merely a set of analytical tools. It is becoming a **public research institution** where serious economic and financial work is created, examined, and shared openly.

The Research Stage transforms Auster from a private analytical workspace into a **public research commons**—a place where economic insight becomes public artifact, where methods are discussable, and where understanding propagates through merit, not marketing.

---

## Core Mission

Build a platform where:
- Economic and financial analyses become **permanent public artifacts**
- Methods and assumptions are **transparent and discussable**
- Inequality, structure, and market behavior can be **investigated openly**
- Independent thinkers can **publish credible findings**
- Insights **propagate through attribution**, not advertising

---

## Design Philosophy

### The Platform Should Feel Like:
- A **public research commons** (not a social network)
- A **statistical discussion venue** (not a comment section)
- A **modern analytical institution** (not a content platform)

### But Capture Engagement Like:
- Reddit's community depth
- Twitter's idea velocity
- Academic publishing's credibility

### Cultural Norms Established Through UX:
- **Rigor over noise**
- **Clarity over volume**
- **Inquiry over ideology**
- **Evidence over rhetoric**
- **Structure over virality**

---

## The Research Object Model

### What is a Research Object?

A research object is **not a post**. It is an **anchored analytical artifact** that includes:

1. **Content Layer**
   - Abstract and key findings
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Data tables and charts
   - Narrative analysis

2. **Methods Layer**
   - Reproducible methodology
   - Explicit assumptions
   - Data sources and transformations
   - Statistical techniques used

3. **Context Layer**
   - Author identity and credentials
   - Publication date and version
   - Links to related analyses
   - Lab workspace state (when applicable)

4. **Discussion Layer**
   - Structured commentary
   - Methodology critiques
   - Extension proposals
   - Replication attempts

### Research Object Types

1. **Economic Research**
   - Long-run structural analysis
   - Inequality investigations
   - Labor market studies
   - Macro pattern discovery

2. **Econometric Analysis**
   - Hypothesis tests
   - Regression studies
   - Causal inference work
   - Model comparisons

3. **Market Analysis**
   - Derivatives strategy breakdowns
   - Options market studies
   - Volatility research
   - Risk analysis

4. **Data Explorations**
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Time-series investigations
   - Cross-sectional comparisons
   - Distribution analyses

---

## Publishing Flow

### From Lab to Stage

1. **Create in Lab** → User works in Econ Lab or Derivatives Lab
2. **Prepare for Publishing** → Add abstract, methods, discussion prompt
3. **Review & Publish** → Generate permanent URL with attribution
4. **Share & Discuss** → Research object becomes public, discussion opens
5. **Extend & Fork** → Others can replicate, extend, or challenge

### Publishing Requirements

Every research object must include:
- ✅ **Title** (clear, specific)
- ✅ **Abstract** (2-4 sentences)
- ✅ **Key Findings** (3-5 bullets)
- ✅ **Methods** (transparent, reproducible)
- ✅ **Assumptions** (explicit)
- ✅ **Author Identity** (credible)
- ⚠️ **Discussion Prompt** (optional but recommended)

---

## Engagement Model

### How Engagement Works

Engagement is **not** driven by:
- ❌ Likes or reactions
- ❌ Virality metrics
- ❌ Follower counts
- ❌ Trending algorithms

Engagement **is** driven by:
- ✅ **Questions** (methodological inquiries)
- ✅ **Critiques** (evidence-based challenges)
- ✅ **Extensions** (building on findings)
- ✅ **Replications** (verifying results)
- ✅ **Interpretations** (alternative readings)

### Discussion Structure

Comments are structured around:
1. **Methodology** → "How was this calculated?"
2. **Evidence** → "What data supports this?"
3. **Reasoning** → "Why this interpretation?"
4. **Implications** → "What does this mean?"

---

## Researcher Profiles

### Profile Components

1. **Identity**
   - Name and credentials
   - Research interests
   - Institutional affiliations (if any)

2. **Contribution History**
   - Published research objects
   - Discussion participation
   - Replications and extensions
   - Citations and attribution

3. **Credibility Signals**
   - Peer engagement quality
   - Methodological rigor
   - Transparency score
   - Community standing

4. **Public Workspace**
   - Featured analyses
   - Work in progress
   - Collaborative projects

---

## Referral System: Attribution for Insight

### Philosophy

Referrals are **not** "invite your friends."

Referrals are **attribution for insight.**

Growth occurs through:
- Shared analyses
- Embedded charts
- Published findings
- Collaborative workspaces

### How It Works

1. **Every Research Object Carries:**
   - Author credit
   - "Built on Auster" mark
   - Personal referral link
   - Attribution chain

2. **Sharing Unlocks:**
   - Expanded workspace capacity
   - Higher compute limits
   - Publishing tools
   - Profile credibility
   - Featured placement
   - Early lab access

3. **Incentive Structure:**
   - Rewards **contribution**, not promotion
   - Values **quality**, not quantity
   - Privileges **rigor**, not reach

### Attribution Chain

```
Original Research Object
  ↓
  Shared by Author → +1 attribution point
  ↓
  Discussed by Peer A → +0.5 attribution point
  ↓
  Extended by Peer B → +1 attribution point, creates new object
  ↓
  Cited by Peer C → +0.5 attribution point
```

All contributors earn attribution credit.

## Cultural Norms

The platform establishes norms through design:

1. **Questions > Opinions**
   - Discussion prompts ask for evidence
   - UI privileges inquiry over assertion

2. **Methods > Conclusions**
   - Methods are first-class content
   - Transparency is rewarded

3. **Attribution > Promotion**
   - Growth comes from contribution
   - Credit flows to originators

4. **Structure > Noise**
   - Signal is separated from chatter
   - Quality is privileged over volume

---

## Conclusion

The Research Stage transforms Auster from a set of analytical tools into a **public research institution**—a place where economic and financial insight becomes public artifact, where methods are transparent, and where understanding propagates through merit.

This is where serious analytical work lives—and where it is challenged, extended, and shared.
